# What's this?
A repo containing practice code for interviews, etc. It contains code for data structures and algorithms, practice problems, interview questions, and code sims.

I've written most of these in C, C++, or Ruby.

## Data Structures:
- heap
- linked list
- binary search tree
- TODO:
  - trie

## Sorting Algorithms
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quicksort
- merge sort
- heap sort
- TODO:
  - counting sort
  - radix sort
  - bucket sort

## Other Algorithms
- find kth largest value in unsorted array (aka "kth order statistic")
- tree traversal (pre/in/post-order)
- TODO:
  - min-cost path / Djikstra's algorithm
  - m-th to last element in list (PII 41)
  - list flattening (PII 44) and unflattening (PII 48)

## Dynamic Programming
- TODO: misc problems from www.geeksforgeeks.org

## Other Random Problems
- see misc/ subdir
- TODO:
  - print all permutations / combinations of a set of letters / numbers
  - write an elevator class in C++

## TO STUDY:
- dynamic programming problems: knapsack, etc...
- graph algorithms
